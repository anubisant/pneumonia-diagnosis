## About this project

We are **Software Engineering students from University of Brasilia - UnB, Brazil**.
We take great interest in artificial inteligence and **we are excited to help the
worldwide comunity in any way we can**. But, **for this specific project, we'd like
to make the difference by helping doctors to diagnose whether a patient has
pneumonia or not**.

## Our main objectives

As we develop this project, we want to put our aquired AI habilities  during our carrer and during our classes in practice. Also, we want to provide the open source community and our fellow students the opportunity to work in a reasonable and important project as they can become contibutors.

## Our goal

We'd like to make the difference by helping doctors to diagnose whether a patient has
pneumonia or not.

## The problem

- Effectively diagnose pneumonia just by looking to chest x-ray images.

## Our solution

- Develop AI algorithms using artificial neural networks to help diagnose pneumonia from x-ray images of a patient's chest.

## Kaggle dataset

Content
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.

## Dependencies
